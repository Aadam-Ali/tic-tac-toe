# Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses)

üñ•Ô∏è [Live Preview](https://aadam-ali.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Description

This tic-tac-toe application allows 2 users to play the game and can detect when a player has won or whether the match has ended in a draw. In its current state it is the most basic funtionality required for a tic-tac-toe application.

## Future Plans

I plan to implement an AI player into the game, particularly making use of the unbeatable minmax algorithm as well as AI that can be beaten.

## Known Bugs

To my knowledge there are no bugs in the functionality of the code. However, there are issues with the styling when using the application on smaller devices, such as mobile phones, where the header text overlaps the match message.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
